# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNING

---

## ‚ùó This code will VERY LIKELY FAIL with a `BadImageFormatException`.

### Why?

1. **64-bit vs 32-bit**
   - The **Canon EDSDK (`EDSDK.dll`)** is a **32-bit (x86)** library, as confirmed by the official PDF (page 12).

2. **Your Project**
   - A **.NET 8 Web API** project runs as a **64-bit (x64)** process by default.

---

## üö´ Problem

A **64-bit process CANNOT load a 32-bit DLL**.

Even if you force your Web API to run in 32-bit mode (see `.csproj` notes), running **hardware-control SDKs** inside a web server is **not recommended**.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Considerations

- The server may not have **USB permissions**.
- Managing the camera's state (like an open session) in a **web request** is very unstable.

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Solution

Create a **separate 32-bit Desktop Application** (such as **WPF** or **Windows Forms**) to control the camera safely.
